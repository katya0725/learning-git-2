        <h1>A Psalm of Life by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882)</h1>
        <p>
            Tell me not, in mournful numbers,<br>
            Life is but an empty dream!<br>
            For the soul is dead that slumbers,<br>
            And things are not what they seem.<br>
            Life is real! Life is earnest!<br>
            And the grave is not its goal;<br>
            Dust thou art, to dust returnest,<br>
            Was not spoken of the soul.<br>
            Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,<br>
            Is our destined end or way;<br>
            But to act, that each tomorrow<br>
            Find us farther than today.<br>
        </p>
